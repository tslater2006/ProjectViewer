<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project allows you to inspect the contents of an Application Designer Project file without having to run a compare report or import it into a database.

This can be useful in scenarios where you have a backup project exported and need to retrieve/look at a piece of code from it, but don't necessarily want to import the entire PeopleCode program.

Another use-case I've found is confirming if an item was included in a project file or not.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

There are 2 ways to obtain this software, you can either clone this repository and build using Visual Studio, or grab a binary release from the releases page.

### Installation

This application is offered in a standalone configuration meaning there is no installation process. Either build it locally or grab a binary release and unzip it to the folder of your choosing. Running ProjectViewer.exe from that location will open the software.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once the application is running, you can start by opening a project file with File -> Open. Once open, a listing of all definitions present in the project will be shown in a tree view on the left. Clicking one of these will open an overview similar to the "Upgrade" tab in Application Designer.

For supported objects (a limited set currently) you can further inspect these items by double clicking, for example PeopleCode/HTML/CSS definitions support this.



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/tslater2006/ProjectViewer/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
